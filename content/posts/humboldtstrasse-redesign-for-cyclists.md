As part of my cycling infrastructure planning and design class my group and I redesigned a major cycling corridor in Southeast Munich. 
Our analysis involved an extensive safety audit, demand estimation, and determining the level of traffic stress throughout the corridor.
Based on our results We provided recommendations for all identified design deficiencies and redesigned the most significant one, the Giesinger Berg intersection, as it disrupted the connectivity of the network.

### context
The 1.2 km corridor is located in the southeast part of the city. Its alignment is the border between the Au, Untergiesing, and Obergiesing neighborhoods. The corridor leads to Wittelsbacher Bridge, one of the main crossings of the Isar river. This makes it a key connection to the city center for both cyclists as well as motorized traffic.

### level of traffic stress

As part of the problem analysis, we estimated demand, analyzed crash data, and performed an on-site safety audit. However, the main aspect of the analysis was our quality of service indicator, the level of traffic stress (LTS). LTS is a normative approach to evaluating cycling infrastructure which was originally developed by [Peter Furth](https://peterfurth.sites.northeastern.edu/level-of-traffic-stress/). Rather than operational performance, the measure is based on Dutch design standards. The method is used to estimate the level of stress imposed on cyclists by a given segment or intersection in the network. The LTS ranges from 1 - 4 and corresponds to different profiles of cyclists:

1. **low level of stress**, suitable for children
2. **medium level of stress**, suitable for the mainstream, adult population (i.e. those who are "interested but concerned")
3. **high level of stress**, suitable for those who are "enthused and confident"
4. **very high level of stress**, suitable only for those who are "strong and fearless"

LTS criteria is based on variables such as physical separation, width of the bike lane, number of traffic lanes, speed limit, and presence of parking. As the [original LTS criteria](https://transweb.sjsu.edu/research/Low-Stress-Bicycling-and-Network-Connectivity) were developed for use in San Jose, California, we made adaptations to make it suitable for the German, urban context. 

Following a "weakest link" logic, the LTS of a route is the maximum LTS of the elements that the route is comprised of. For example, the  following route would be classified as **LTS 3**.
 
<b><p style="text-align: center;">A (LTS 1) --> B (LTS 3) --> C (LTS 1)</p></b>

This makes the LTS very useful for network analyses, particularly for identifying gaps in connectivity. In our study area, the LTS clearly highlights the inadequacy of the Giesinger Berg intersection. With an LTS of 4 at many of its approaches, the intersection is a barrier to most users. This is critical, given its importance to Munich's cycling network.

### giesinger berg intersection redesign

There are three major traffic generators surrounding the intersection: the Heilig Kreuz church, [Giesinger Brewery](https://www.giesinger-braeu.de/) (my favorite!), and a large
elementary school. The design of the intersection prioritizes
motor vehicles and delay over the needs of cyclists or pedestrians. There are no surface-level pedestrian crossings, instead they are facilitated by an underpass. Presently, the intersection
cannot be crossed by wheelchair users as most entrances only have stairs and the provided ramp is very steep, narrow, and cobbled.

**Ichostr. to Martin-Luther Str.** Presently this turn is the most dangerous movement in the intersection as it requires entering mixed-traffic from a grade-separated path and crossing multiple lanes of fast-moving traffic. This was addressed by implementing a separated path and accompanying signal phasing, which also allowed for barrier-free, surface-level pedestrian crossings to be accommodated. 

**Martin-Luther Str. to Giesinger Berg / Silberhornstr.** For through traffic, the curvature of the intersection was increased and motor vehicle lane widths were reduced to make space for a bike lane. A bike lane was also implemented along the right turn so there would be a comfortable transition to the existing bike path. 

**Giesinger Berg to Silberhornstr.** For this turn the curb was extended to allow for additional queuing area and separation from pedestrians and cyclists continuing south.
