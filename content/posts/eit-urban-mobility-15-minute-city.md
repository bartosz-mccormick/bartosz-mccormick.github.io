The 15-Minute City has gained lots of attention in recent years, perhaps most notably with Paris adopting the concept as part of
its official planning policy. This report, while contextualized by the 15-Minute City, is a broader synthesis of chrono-urbanist 
planning concepts which seek to improve livability and make  transport more sustainable by *enabling*[^1] access to everyday 
needs within a close distance of one's home.

One of the main elements of the report is a roadmap for implementing the 15-Minute City. My contribution to the report 
was helping develop an "X-Minute City" indicator which can be used to measure the level of access to essential amenities within a city. 
The indicator was presented within the framework as an example of how accessibility can be measured and areas of need can be identified.
I demonstrated the applicability of the indicator by using it to analyze five European cities (Amsterdam, Ghent, Madrid, Milan, and Munich).

[^1]: The key really is *enabling* access. Some cities' inclusion of these principles into their plans were supplemented by 
traffic management schemes aiming to mitigate private car use. These plans were seen as restrictive and were strongly criticized.
This criticism unfortunately spiraled into the misrepresentation of the 15-Minute City (and related concepts) as the promotion of
segmenting cities into independent, access-controlled zones. The 15-Minute City aims to make it possible, not required, to meet
all daily needs within a short distance by foot or bike. The concept is more so [mundane](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/16/15-minute-city-planning-theory-conspiracists) than radical, and certainly doesn't warrant
[death threats](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/28/technology/carlos-moreno-15-minute-cities-conspiracy-theories.html). As far as freedom goes, I am of the mind that urban forms which necessitate driving are oppressive, not ones which let children ride their bikes to school.
