Rather than a thesis, my bachelor's culminated in a senior design project. Over the course of a year, my team and I redesigned the intersection of New London Turnpike and Asylum Street in Norwich, CT. Our goal was to make the intersection safer while also taking the opportunity to provide facilities for pedestrians and cyclists. We designed a roundabout and our team was awarded second place in our department's design competition. Below is a short video describing the project.
